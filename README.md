# TypeScript Practice

This repository contains small, focused TypeScript exercises I used to get
comfortable with Node.js + TypeScript fundamentals.

The goal is not polished production code, but:
- Practising TypeScript syntax and types
- Writing small, testable functions
- Getting comfortable reading and reasoning about TS code
- Using tests to verify behaviour

Exercises include:
- Date-based filtering
- Array and object transformations
- Basic unit tests with Vitest
